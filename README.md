# Hibiki-v3
The ultimate all-in-one Discord bot, but even better. Proper README coming soon.

## Setup
Figure it out yourself, idiot

## Temp Note
Anything in the lib folder will be pushed to a Verniy repo once we're done, except for anything specific for Hibiki.

Probably like this on the Verniy repo: 

ðŸ“‚ Root

\> src/[lib folder - it's the core]
