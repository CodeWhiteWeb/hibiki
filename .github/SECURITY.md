# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Currently, the latest version of Hibiki is only officially supported. 
Additionaly, if you have found a vulnerability with a production build of 3.x.x older than the current master branch, test it in the latest version.
If the vulnerability still exists in the latest production version, then contact us.

Legacy closed-source versions 1 & 2 are no longer supported.
If you are running a legacy version for whatever reason, no support will be given.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have discovered a vulnerability, it's best to directly contact one of us.
